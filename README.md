# gallery-viewer
Wrote this script a while back when the facebook api was more open and didn't require API keys to make requests to get albums from facebook pages.  

This was one of my first personal project to explore JavaScript and JQuery.

The script was used to load images dynamically from the facebook page to clients portfolio site.  It allowed them to manage the photos on their site by modifying the images in specific albums on their facebook page.

Note: Facebook has since closed the loophole to get access to the photos without an api key
